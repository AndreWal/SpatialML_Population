## Overview

This repository is a work in progress focused on compiling and harmonizing subnational population data across countries and time. The objective is to assemble population counts at the smallest feasible administrative units, enabling the estimation of population figures in regions and periods with missing or incomplete data.

The project combines historical and contemporary sources with spatial interpolation techniques to generate consistent, high-resolution population surfaces. The resulting outputs are intended to support comparative research, spatial analysis, and the construction of raster-based population datasets suitable for downstream modeling and visualization.
